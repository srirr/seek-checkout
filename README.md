### To be clean up /Done:

1. Not responsive, easy to fix, but havenâ€™t done yet. Will bring in for Pairing.
2. CSS style sheets. I was planning to use styled components and If any inline styles in the App.tsx file should go inside the App.css or as a styles component in App.tsx

### Assumptions:

1. Stub used for Products -> Assume, Products.json is returned from Product Api call.
2. Pricing rule for various companies are returned from Pricing rules endpoint. Currently stubbed out as the <company-name>.json
3. Did not spent time on making the UI look perfect. Followed a simple UI.
4. Currently showing just the total in the UI, there is capability to show gross total and discount.
